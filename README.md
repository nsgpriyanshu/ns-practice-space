# ns-practice-space

A personal practice repository where I explore, learn, and experiment with various programming concepts.  
This space includes my institute practice programs along with hands-on experiments in different areas such as:

- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- UI/UX components and small interface experiments  
- Trying out different programming languages  
- Testing libraries, packages, and tools  
- Small side projects and code snippets for learning  

The goal of this repository is to keep all my practice work in one place, track my progress, and freely experiment without restrictions.
